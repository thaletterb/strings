# STRINGS

Some simple code to explore the various implementations of strings in C. 

1. Strings as array
	- INCOMPLETE
2. String as pointers
	- IN PROGRESS

## How to compile & run examples:
- Within each directory, are include and src directories where headers and source files are stored (respectively)
- In each src directory, there exists a makefile with rules for compiling executeable binaries. 
- To recompile changes, run $make from the src directory



## Rev. History
12/11/15:
Working my_reverse_string() function in string_as_pointers directory. 

12/10/15: 
First commit. Only strings as pointers code so far

## Done:
12/11/15:
- Reverse string function in string_as_pointers directory COMPLETE

## To Do:
12/10/15:
- Reverse string function in string_as_pointers directory does not work
- Implement same functions from string_as_pointers as string_as_arrays
